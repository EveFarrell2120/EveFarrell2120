## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a game developer working with Unity and C# to create engaging and responsive 2D and 3D games. This repository highlights how I approach game developmentâ€”from implementing core gameplay mechanics to fine-tuning performance and working with Unityâ€™s physics systems.

At the heart of my work is clean, maintainable game logic. I use C# to create modular scripts that control everything from player movement and AI behavior to game state management and UI interactions. I follow a component-based architecture that takes advantage of Unityâ€™s strengths, keeping systems decoupled and easy to extend.

I also focus heavily on integrating physics engines to bring movement and interaction to life. Whether Iâ€™m working with Unityâ€™s built-in 2D or 3D physics systems, I aim to create interactions that feel grounded and responsive. This includes using rigidbodies, colliders, joints, and raycasts, as well as customizing physics materials and layers to match the gameplay design.

Performance optimization is a key part of every project. I regularly profile and optimize game behavior to maintain smooth frame rates, especially on lower-end hardware. I use techniques like object pooling, scene loading strategies, and occlusion culling to reduce memory usage and improve runtime performance. I also structure scripts and systems to minimize overhead from expensive operations like per-frame calculations or frequent instantiations.

This repository represents how I build games that are not only fun to play but also technically solid. If youâ€™re interested in Unity development, performance tuning, or building scalable gameplay systems, I hope this project offers something usefulâ€”whether it's inspiration, reference code, or a foundation for your own ideas.
